Microservices are the number one solution for building and scaling out apps that are intended to **grow**.every major challenge of building microservices is covered in this Project.  

Beyond focusing on Microservices, there is plenty full stack development involved.It includes : 

- Server-side Rendering
- Custom Hooks
- Every Aspect of Back-end 
- Database designing
- Deployment
- And out of everything , DevOps is used here in process of development.

### Technology Used : 

As we have built  a full stack application, we have used variety of technologies

- **React** and **Next JS** to present content to users. 
- Each service is created using **Node** and **Express**
- Data for each service is held in either a **Mongo** database or **Redis**
- The entire app is deployed and runs in **Docker** containers executed in a **Kubernetes** cluster
- For payment integration we have used **Stripe**  and every Node app is written in **Typescript**
